Html, Css, Javascript, Bootstrap are my currently best front-end technologies I am skilled in so far. Python, PHP and SQL are my good technologies that i use to help people solve real life problems through programming, for me Angular and Django are the technonolgies to begin with in programming field since there is a lot to learn, they highlight all the required technologies you need to know for their use.
